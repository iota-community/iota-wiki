# The Firefly Wallet

The Secure Entrypoint to the IOTA Ecosystem.

Firefly is built with the future in mind. It will evolve into a tool that offers much more than being just a Software Wallet for your IOTA Tokens.
Firefly has a modular design that makes it easy to add innovative new features later on.
IOTA's new wallet guides you through the complexities of crypto, protected and with ease, while it is using cutting edge technology to secure your tokens.

Some of the most important features:
- Written in Rust

Rust offers security from the ground up – while maintaining speed, low memory usage, and scalability. This allows us to build apps with better performance and higher security.

- Modular design

Firefly separates different functionalities – like seed storage, handling transactions, and cryptography – in crates. A crate groups related functions, so that the functionality is easy to share between multiple projects.

- Secured with Stronghold

Sensitive actions like address generation and transaction signing take place in isolated application memory, keeping the seed away from potential attackers.

- Crypto.rs

Crypto.rs combines all cryptographic algorithms used by many of the projects at IOTA Foundation. It reduces the risk of using unsafe crypto implementations, making it easier to audit, resulting in verifiably safer code.

## Firefly Token Migration

With the launch of the new IOTA 1.5 Chrysalis Mainnet end of April 28th, it is important that every IOTA Holder migrates his entire Fungs from the old IOTA 1.0 network to the new, much more improved and advanced 1.5 network.

To make this process user-friendly and safe, the IOTA Foundation integrated a migration tool into the Firefly Wallet, that takes care of the whole process and moves your funds automated from the old into the new network. The only thing you need is your old IOTA 1.0 network Seed, represented as a combination of 81 characters, a ``.kdbx seed vault file``that you have backed up from the Trinity Wallet, or your Ledger Nano device.

With this information entered in the Migration Process in Firefly a fully automated process will start and all your Funds will be moved securely into the new network and you will have access to them through Firefly from now on.
