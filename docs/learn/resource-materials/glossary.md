# Glossary 
The following are common terms associated with IOTA and DLT.

<br/>

- [**Access**](https://wiki.iota.org/docs/use/access/secure-access-control) - insert

<br/>

- [**Application Programming Interface (API)**](https://wiki.iota.org/iota.rs/libraries/overview) - insert

<br/>

- [**Bee**](https://wiki.iota.org/bee/welcome) - insert

<br/>

- [**Blockchain**](https://wiki.iota.org/docs/learn/about-iota/an-introduction-to-iota#the-blockchain-data-structure) - A blockchain is a DLT structure that consists of a chain of sequential blocks, where each block contains a limited number of messages written to the ledger by a leader. Blockchain leaders are chosen by various methods depending on the proof methods such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.

<br/>

- [**Chronicle**]...(link) - Chronicle is an IOTA perma-node software designed for exploring and storing data from the Tangle

<br/>

- [**Chrysalis (IOTA 1.5)**](https://wiki.iota.org/docs/learn/networks/iota-1.5-chrysalis) - Chrysalis (IOTA 1.5) is the name given to the current implementation of the IOTA network. Chrysalis succeeded the legacy IOTA 1.0 network in two parts to prepare for the changes planned in the IOTA 2.0 (Coordicide) protocol. 

<br/>

- [**Coordicide (IOTA 2.0)**](https://wiki.iota.org/docs/learn/networks/iota-2.0-coordicide) - Coordicide is the name given to the IOTA 2.0 network which removes the reliance on the coordinator node, fully decentralizing the network. [Official IOTA 2.0 Website](https://v2.iota.org/)

<br/>

- **Coordinator** - The Coordinator is a node operated by the IOTA Foundation that creates "milestones" which a message must be referenced by to be considered valid. During the infancy stages of a DAG-based DLT network, there are certain vulnerabilities due to a smaller network, so the coordinator was implemented to prevent those types of attacks. The coordinator will be removed in IOTA 2.0 as those vulnerabilities are prevented through different methods on the more mature network. 

<br/>

- [**Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**]...(link) - insert

<br/>

- [**DevNet**](https://wiki.iota.org/chrysalis-docs/devnet) - DevNet (Development Network) is the name given to the IOTA 2.0 test network.

- [**Digital Assets**](https://wiki.iota.org/docs/use/use-cases/digital-assets) - Digital assets is the umbrella term for all assets on the IOTA network such as customized IOTA tokens (layer 1) or assets within smart contracts (layer 2). 

<br/>

- [**Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**](https://wiki.iota.org/docs/learn/about-iota/an-introduction-to-iota#the-tangle-data-structure) - A directed acyclic graph is DLT structure that consists of edges and vertices that never form a closed loop. The IOTA architecture "the Tangle" is a form of directed acyclic graph. 

<br/>

- [**Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) - EdDSA is a digital signature scheme based on Schnorr-signatures. EdDSA is used in the current IOTA 1.5 Chrysalis network and replaced the Winternitz-One-Time-Signatures (WOTS) of the legacy IOTA 1.0 network.

- [**IOTA Foundation**](https://www.iota.org/foundation/vision-and-mission) - insert

<br/>

- [**Identity**](https://wiki.iota.org/docs/use/identity/enabling-privacy-and-trust) - IOTA's Decentralized Identity or Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) defines a new method for identity management and authentication. It removes the centralized aspects and puts the Identity subject in full control over its own identity. [Identity details](https://wiki.iota.org/identity.rs/intro).

<br/>

- [**Ledger**](https://www.ledger.com/) - Ledger is a company that manufactures hardware wallets. Ledger devices are officially supported by the Firefly wallet for storing IOTA tokens. [Ledger use with Firefly wallet](https://blog.iota.org/general-use-guide-for-ledger-nano-with-firefly/).

<br/>

- [**Tips**]...(link) - Tips are unreferenced edges (or messages) on the Tangle that represent transactions which are not yet confirmed. The [Tip Selection Algorithm](https://wiki.iota.org/IOTA-2.0-Research-Specifications/4.3%20Tip%20Selection%20Algorithm) is an important factor which allows the Tangle to grow securely and to confirm transactions quickly.

<br/>

- **Trinity** - Trinity was the IOTA 1.0 legacy network official wallet which is no longer supported or being developed. Migration of tokens from the old network can be completed with the new Firefly wallet.
