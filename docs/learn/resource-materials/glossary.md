# Glossary

This page contains definitions of common terms and phrases related to IOTA.

## A

**Address** Where IOTA are sent to and from.

## B

**Balance **The amount of IOTA on a particular address.

**Bee** Node software developed by the IOTA foundation using the Rust programming language.

**Blockchain **Blockchain is a data structure used by many other distributed ledger technologies. Bitcoin is the most famous example of this.

## C

**Confirmed** A transaction is called 'confirmed' when it is final and cannot be reversed.

**CTPS** Confirmed transactions per second - an indication of the throughput of the IOTA network.

**Comnet** The community-maintained network.

**Chronicle** Permanode software developed by the IOTA foundation.

**Consensus** Agreement of nodes on the state of the network.

**Coordinator** The Coordinator is the node ran by the IOTA Foundation that issues milestones. Currently, transactions are deemed valid only after it has been referenced (either directly or indirectly) by a milestone.

**Chrysalis **Chrysalis is the name of the IOTA 1.5 network upgrade.

## D

**Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** The data structure used by IOTA to arrange transactions over time.

**Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)** Any technology that focuses on the distribution of a ledger. (Almost) all cryptocurrencies, including IOTA, are Distributed Ledger Technologies.

**Devnet** The Devnet (developer network) is an IOTA network maintained by the IOTA Foundation that is used for testing purposes.

**Dust protection** Dust protection is a mechanism that prevents the accumulation of small amounts of IOTA on addresses. Using the UTXO model, a node needs to keep track of all addresses and their balances. An attacker could try to bloat the UTXO database by spreading IOTA tokens over a very large number of addresses. To prevent this, a minimum amount is required to be on a particular address.

## F

**Firefly **Firefly is an IOTA wallet developed by the IOTA Foundation accompanying the Chrysalis (IOTA 1.5) release.

**Fullnode **A fullnode is a node that keeps track of all messages and transactions in the network.

## G

**GoShimmer **[GoShimmer](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/) is a "Prototype node software for an IOTA network without the Coordinator"

## H

**Hornet** Hornet is community maintained node software.

## L

**Local snapshot **A local snapshot is a snapshot that is done by one IOTA node - in contrast to a Snapshot that is done by the entire network. This is most often done to clean up disk space.

## M

**Mainnet **The main IOTA network.

**Milestone **Milestones are messages issued by the Coordinator, that allow transactions to confirm.

**Message** A message is the general term for value and data transactions.

**Messages per Second (MPS) **The amount of messages issued to the network every second.

**Mana** Mana is something that IOTA nodes can accrue when being trustworthy. Mana is used to prevent sybil attacks and handle congestion.

## N

**Neighbors** Neighbors are the nodes that a particular node is configured to communicate with.

**Node **A device that processes IOTA messages.

## O

**Orphan** A message is called an orphan when it is never referenced by a milestone, thus causing it to never confirm.

**Oracle* ***An oracle is a trusted source of data.

**On Tangle Voting (OTV)** A new consensus mechanism that allows nodes to vote on conflicts directly by publishing a message to the tangle.

## P

**Parent **A message is called a parent when there is one or more messages referencing it.

**Pending** A message is pending when it is published to the network, but not yet confirmed.

**Pruning* ***Pruning is the process of removing unnecessary data. In the context of IOTA, it most often means the removal of old messages from the database of a node.

**Permanode** A permanode (permanent node) is a node that keeps track of all messages and transactions on the IOTA network.

## Q

## R

**Reusable Address** Reusable addresses are addresses that you can send funds from more than once. This has been a feature of IOTA since the Chrysalis release.

## S

**Seed **A seed is a random string of characters that serve as the key to the funds locked in an address.

**Sharding* ***Sharding is a method of splitting up parts of the network to improve transaction throughput.

**Signature** A sequence of data that is used to authorize the transfer of IOTA.

**Smart Contract** Smart contracts are contracts or programs that are automatically executed.

## T

**Tangle** The name commonly used to refer to the IOTA DAG, the data structure in which messages are kept.

**Transactions per second (TPS) **Same as MPS.

**Token **The IOTA token.

**Trinity **The discontinued wallet that was used up until the release of the Firefly wallet.

**Tip* ***A message in the tangle that is deemed appropriate as a parent.

## U

**Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)** A model to simplify keeping track of the funds in all addresses. It is used in Bitcoin, IOTA (since Chrysalis) and many other cryptocurrencies.

## V

**Value Transaction **A message that sends IOTA tokens.

## W

**Wasp **The Wasp node software is an implementation of Smart Contracts on the IOTA Tangle.
