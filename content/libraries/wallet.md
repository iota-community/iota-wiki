## wallet.rs

The [wallet.rs library](/wallet.rs/wallet.rs/welcome) is written
in [Rust](/wallet.rs/getting_started/rust), and
has bindings for [Java](/wallet.rs/getting_started/java)
[Java for Android](/wallet.rs/getting_started/java_for_android),
, [NodeJs](/wallet.rs/getting_started/nodejs)
, and [Python](/wallet.rs/getting_started/python).

Both the IOTA Foundation and the IOTA community maintain the library and this
wiki, which means that you can rely on it as a source of knowledge on wallet.rs.
