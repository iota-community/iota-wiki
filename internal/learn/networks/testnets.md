# Test and Development Networks

The IOTA Foundation and the IOTA community members operate several development networks (DevNets) in which different stages of the IOTA protocol and new applications can be tested and optimized. This is a playground for developers and researchers. The assets used in DevNets are simply DevNet tokens with no real-world value.

## IOTA DevNet

The official development network where developers can test their apps and integrations against the currently supported IOTA Mainnet version. Currently, the DevNet runs the IOTA 1.5 Chrysalis protocol.

In this DevNet, the coordinator and some public nodes are run by the IOTA Foundation. You can use the DevNet to test apps for IOTA 1.5. You can find the full [**IOTA 1.5 Devnet  documentation**](/chrysalis-docs/devnet) in the [Chrysalis Docs](/chrysalis-docs/welcome).

## Shimmer Beta Testnet

Shimmer is an incentivized staging network for the IOTA Mainnet. Its beta testnet serves as the first testing ground for new and upcoming features that will get progressively added to Shimmer and later to IOTA.

TheShimmer Beta Testnet will launch with the Stardust protocol.

## IOTA 2.0 Decentralized DevNet

The IOTA 2.0 Decentralized DevNet implements the upcoming fully decentralized IOTA 2.0 protocol. This network does not use or need a coordinator. It uses Devnet IOTA tokens without value to fine-tune, test, and optimize the upcoming development stage of the IOTA protocol together with the IOTA community. This network is composed of [GoShimmer](https://wiki.iota.org/goshimmer/welcome) nodes. While many nodes in the 2.0 DevNet are run and maintained by the IOTA Foundation, you can [contribute by running your own nodes](https://wiki.iota.org/goshimmer/tutorials/setup). A more extensive network is beneficial for testing newly researched and developed concepts and ideas, catching bugs, and ironing out finished components.
