## Vision

Stardust is a comprehensive utility upgrade of the IOTA protocol. The main components of Stardust are support for IOTA smart contract (ISC) chains, a new tokenization framework for native assets, revised dust protection, and many minor convenience and security updates. With Stardust, IOTA transforms into a multi-asset ledger and enables running smart contracts.

The origin of Stardust dates back to the first experimental research implementation of the IOTA 2.0 protocol. While working on the new protocol concepts of IOTA 2.0 for ISC, the IOTA Foundation identified that a standalone ledger module could be ported separately to the Mainnet without modifying the consensus-related aspects of Chrysalis.

Hence a new protocol version called Stardust was specified to bring these new features to IOTA as soon as possible.

## Launch

Stardust launches on Shimmer first, the new staging network for IOTA that has its own token, SMR. After careful testing and fine-tuning, Stardust is ported to the IOTA Mainnet and replaces Chrysalis.

## Claiming SMR tokens in Shimmer

Once the Shimmer network launches, users will be able to claim their SMR tokens received after the 90 days SMR staking period. The exact claiming process will be defined later, but you will only need to download the new version of the Firefly wallet that supports claiming SMR staking rewards.

## Migration to Mainnet

Once Stardust reaches maturity, it will be ported to the IOTA Mainnet. There will not be a migration process as there was for Chrysalis, as Stardust is just an evolution of the Chrysalis protocol.

Ideally, you'll just need to download the new wallet software, and you can continue using your IOTA funds on the Mainnet.
