# Future of Shimmer

![Shimmer](/img/learn/future/shimmer.svg 'Click to see the full-size image.')

In November 2021, the IOTA Foundation [introduced Shimmer](https://blog.iota.org/introducing-iota-staking/), an incentivized staging network. Shimmer will function as a validation and staging network for upcoming IOTA updates before they arrive on the mainnet. It will also have its own token called [SMR](https://shimmer.network/token). To fairly distribute Shimmer tokens on the new network, IOTA holders [could stake their tokens](https://blog.iota.org/iota-staking-start/) to receive Shimmer tokens once the new network starts. You may verify the results of the 90-day pre-launch staking using the [staking event overview JSON file](https://github.com/iotaledger/participation-events/blob/master/events/staking/shimmer.json) and [staking results JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotaledger/participation-events/master/results/staking/shimmer.json).

## Post-launch staking

After the Shimmer network launches, you will be able to stake your SMR tokens directly to receive more SMR tokens. An initial annual percentage yield (APY) of 8% is planned. This can be changed later by the community. More information will follow on post-launch staking.

Please keep in mind that post-launch SMR staking will not start immediately after the Shimmer network launch, as the main objective is to validate the new protocol on Shimmer before it hits the IOTA Mainnet.

## Iterative Updates

Shimmer launches with the Stardust protocol, but there are many features that are currently in research that will debut on Shimmer. If you are interested, browse the [Tangle Improvement Proposal discussion forum](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/discussions), share your ideas and contribute.

An excerpt of features currently under discussion are:

- [Swapping of native assets](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/discussions/42).
- [Binary endpoints for the IoT ecosystem](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/discussions/67).
- [Human readable addresses](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/discussions/64).
