In this article you decentralized applications work and how users can interact with it.

# Decentralized Applications

A decentralized applications (dApps) are in general computer applications which runs on a decentralized computing system like IOTA Smart Contracts.

There are some exciting aspects of dApps:

- No downtime - Based on a peer-to-peer system ensures the dApps continue to work even if individual computers or parts of the network go offline.
- Censorship-resistant - With no single point of failure and based on the Tangle, itâ€™s impossible to takeover the Network and censor your dApp.
- Open-source - This brings even more trust to dApps - if the source code is public available and can be proven by many developers.

## Architecture

Decentralized applications consist of one or multiple Smart Contracts and a User Interface. The user interface mostly results in a Website, which is interacting with the Smart Contracts.
